# VBA-challenge
This is a VBA script that takes yearly stock data and finds the early change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and also find the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price.

The script also finds the highest stock volume as well.

On line 72 I struggled to make the decimal places stay showing only 2 decimal places and used help from stack overflow to figure that out. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46790877/advanced-consolidation-in-vba 

On line 102 I also used script from stack overflow that helps me close off the conditional formatting so the red or green formatting does not go to the end of the spreadsheet. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47453922/how-to-stop-loop-if-current-cell-selection-is-empty
